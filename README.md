# Avro-using-Spark

This code creates an AVRO file using Apache Spark 
The code is written in Scala

This code changes JSON file into AVRO, you can change any type of file format here instead of JSON, just take care of the syntax(if any error occurs)

Note: If you're using it, kindly choose the maven dependencies for SBT carefully (As this is the thing that gives most of the errors)
